# Review: CV Setup Options

To use the Verify step, you will need a Harness Service Reliability Management Monitored Service. In the simplest terms, a Harness Monitored Service is a Service and Environment combination that Harness monitors for:

* Any changes, such as deployments, infrastructure changes, and incidents
* Any health trend deviations using logs and metrics obtained from APM and Logging tools, respectively

No matter where you set up the Monitored Service, once it's set up, it's available to both Service Reliability Management and CD modules.

In this topic, we set up the Harness Monitored Service as part of the Verify step setup.
