# Script Input Variables

While you can simply declare a variable in your script using a Harness expression or string for its value, using **Script Input Variables** provides some additional benefits:

* You can more easily identify and manage the Harness expressions used in your script.
* You can template your script.

You can declare the variable using **Name** and **Value** in **Script Input Variables** and then reference the variable in the script just as you would any other variable: `$var_name`.
