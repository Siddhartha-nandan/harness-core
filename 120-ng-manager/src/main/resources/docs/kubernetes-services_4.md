### Ignore a manifest file during deployment

You might have manifest files for resources that you do not want to deploy as part of the main deployment.

Instead, you can tell Harness to ignore these files and then apply them separately using the HarnessÂ [Apply](../../cd-technical-reference/cd-k8s-ref/kubernetes-apply-step.md) step. Or you can simply ignore them and deploy them later.

See [Ignore a manifest file during deployment](../../cd-advanced/cd-kubernetes-category/ignore-a-manifest-file-during-deployment.md) and [Kubernetes Apply Step](../../cd-technical-reference/cd-k8s-ref/kubernetes-apply-step.md).
