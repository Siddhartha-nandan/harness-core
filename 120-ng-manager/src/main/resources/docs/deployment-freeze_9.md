## Access control

Deployment freeze access control is configured using the **Deployment Freeze** role permissions.

- **Manage**: add/edit/delete freeze at any level.
- **Override**: When a deployment is required during a freeze duration, users with this role can still perform deployments.
- **Global**: enable/disable freeze across all deployments at account, org, and project levels.
