## Define log configuration settings

1. On the Configuration tab, select **+ Add Query**.  
   
   The Add Query dialog appears.

2. Enter a name for the query and then select **Submit**.  
   
   The query that you added gets listed under the Logs Group. The Custom Queries settings are displayed.
   These settings help you retrieve the desired logs from the Elasticsearch platform and map them to the Harness service.
