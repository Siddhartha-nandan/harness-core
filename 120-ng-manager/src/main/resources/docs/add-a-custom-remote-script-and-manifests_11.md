# OpenShift manifest

Provide the path to the OpenShift template, Kubernetes manifest, or Helm file. For example, manifest/template.yaml.

Do not enter a folder. Harness requires a direct path to the file.

That's all the setup required. You can now deploy the Service and the script is executed at runtime.
