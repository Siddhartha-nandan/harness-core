# Review: Primary and Sidecar Artifacts

You can add a primary artifact and multiple sidecar artifacts. The sidecars are treated the same as the primary artifact. Both are deployed to the target infrastructure in the **Infrastructure Definition**.

You don't need to create a separate Service for a sidecar artifact. Both are added in the Service Definition. The steps for adding them are the same.

You must select artifact versions at deployment runtime for all primary and sidecar artifacts.
