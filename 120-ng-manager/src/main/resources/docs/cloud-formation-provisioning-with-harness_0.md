:::info

Dynamic provisioning is only supported in [Service and Environments v1](../../onboard-cd/upgrading/upgrade-cd-v2). Dynamic provisioning will be added to Service and Environments v2 soon. Until then, you can create a stage to provision the target infrastructure and then a subsequent stage to deploy to that provisioned infrastructure.

:::

This topic provides an overview of how to use CloudFormation to provision infrastructure as part of your deployment process.

Harness can provision any resource that is supported by CloudFormation.
