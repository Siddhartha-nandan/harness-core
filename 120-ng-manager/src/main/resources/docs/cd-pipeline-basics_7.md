## Connectors

Connectors contain the information necessary to integrate and work with 3rd party tools such as Git providers, artifact repos, and target infrastructure.

Harness uses Connectors at Pipeline runtime to authenticate and perform operations with a 3rd party tool.

For example, a GitHub Connector authenticates with a GitHub account and repo and fetches files as part of a deploy Stage.

For example, see:

* [Add a Kubernetes Cluster Connector](../../../platform/7_Connectors/add-a-kubernetes-cluster-connector.md)
* [Docker Connector Settings Reference](../../../platform/7_Connectors/ref-cloud-providers/docker-registry-connector-settings-reference.md)
* [Git Connector Settings Reference](../../../platform/7_Connectors/ref-source-repo-provider/git-connector-settings-reference.md)
