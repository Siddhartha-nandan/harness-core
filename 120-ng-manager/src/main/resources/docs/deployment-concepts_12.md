### Pros

* Deploy in small phases (e.g. 2%, 10%, 25%, 50,%, 75%, 100%).
* Lowest risk relative to all other deployment strategies (reduce business exposure).
* Test in production with real users & use cases.
* Run & compare two service versions side-by-side.
* Cheaper than blue/green, because there is no need to have two production environments.
* Fast and safe rollback.
