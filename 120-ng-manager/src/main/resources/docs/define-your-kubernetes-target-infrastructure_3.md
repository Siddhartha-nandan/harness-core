# Select or create an environment

Let's take a moment and review Harness Environments and Infrastructure Definitions.

Harness Environments represent your deployment targets logically (QA, Prod, etc). You can add the same Environment to as many stages are you need. Infrastructure Definitions represent your target infrastructure physically. They are the actual clusters, hosts, etc.

By separating Environments and Infrastructure Definitions, you can use the same Environment in multiple stages while changing the target infrastructure settings with each stage.
