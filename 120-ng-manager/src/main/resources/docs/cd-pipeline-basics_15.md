### Conditional Executions

You can set conditions on when you run Stages and steps. For example, `Execute This Stage Only if Prior Pipeline or Stage Failed`.

The stage Conditional Execution applies to all steps that do not have their own Conditional Execution. A step's Conditional Execution overrides its stage's Conditional Execution.

See [Stage and Step Conditional Execution Settings](../../../platform/8_Pipelines/w_pipeline-steps-reference/step-skip-condition-settings.md).
