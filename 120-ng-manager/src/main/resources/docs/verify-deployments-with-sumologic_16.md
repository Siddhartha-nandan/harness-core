### Map service instance identifier

:::note
The **Map service instance identifier** section is only visible if you have selected **Continuous Verification (Applied to the pipelines in the Continuous Deployment**) in the **Assign** section.
:::

In **Service Instance Identifier (only needed for CV)**, specify the service instance identifier, which represents a dynamically created service that you deploy using Harness. The default value is `_sourceHost`.
