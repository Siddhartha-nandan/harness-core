# Option: Targets

You can use the **Targets** setting to target one or more specific modules in your Terraform script, just like using the `terraform plan -target` command. See [Resource Targeting](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/plan.html#resource-targeting) from Terraform.

You simply identify the module using the standard format `module.name`, like you would using `terraform plan -target="module.s3_bucket"`.

If you have multiple modules in your script and you don't select one in **Targets**, all modules are used.
