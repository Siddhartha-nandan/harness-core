# Step 1: Define the Service and Infrastructure

Create your CD Pipeline stage.

To set up your Service and Infrastructure in the stage, follow the steps in these topics:

* [Add Kubernetes Manifests](../../cd-advanced/cd-kubernetes-category/define-kubernetes-manifests.md)
* [Define Your Kubernetes Target Infrastructure](../../cd-infrastructure/kubernetes-infra/define-your-kubernetes-target-infrastructure.md)

Once the Service and Infrastructure are set up, you can add the execution steps.
