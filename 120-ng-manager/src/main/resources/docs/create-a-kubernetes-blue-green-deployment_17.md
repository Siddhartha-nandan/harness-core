* **Blue/Green Rollback** â€” A great benefit of a Blue/Green deployment is rapid rollback: rolling back to the old version of a service/artifact is simple and reliable because network traffic is simply routed back to the original instances. You do not need to redeploy previous versions of the service/artifact and the instances that comprised their environment.
