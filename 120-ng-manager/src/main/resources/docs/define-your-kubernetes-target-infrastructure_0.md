When you set up a Deploy stage, you specify the Kubernetes cluster you want to target for deployment as a Harness Infrastructure Definition.

A Harness Infrastructure Definition specifies the target deployment infrastructure for your Harness stage. It includes specific infrastructure details for the deployment, such as the Harness Connector that provides credentials for the cluster and the cluster namespace.

:::note

For Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) and OpenShift, use [Specify a Vendor Agnostic Kubernetes Cluster](define-your-kubernetes-target-infrastructure.md#specify-a-vendor-agnostic-kubernetes-cluster).
