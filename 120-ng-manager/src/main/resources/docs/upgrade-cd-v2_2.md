# Customer impact

Here's a summary of the impact to Harness accounts:

- The changes only impact your CD module. No other modules are impacted.
- No impact on any existing pipelines using v1 services and environments. 
- Post 1/31/2023, when you create a new CD stage in an existing pipeline, the v2 experience will be the default.

:::note

Please note that any new services and environments created in Harness after 1/31/2023 will use the new v2 experience.
