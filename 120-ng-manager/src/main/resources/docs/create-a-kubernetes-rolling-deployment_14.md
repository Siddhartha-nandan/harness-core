## Rolling Rollback step

You can add a **Rolling Rollback** step to your stage to roll back the workloads deployed by the **Rollout Deployment** step.

Simply add this step where you want to initiate a rollback. Note that this command applies to the deployments of the Rollout Deployment command, and not the [Apply Step](deploy-manifests-using-apply-step.md) command.
