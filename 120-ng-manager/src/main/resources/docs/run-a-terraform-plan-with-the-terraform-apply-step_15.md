# Option: Workspace

Harness supports Terraform [workspaces](https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/workspaces.html). A Terraform workspace is a logical representation of one your infrastructures, such as Dev, QA, Stage, Production.

Workspaces are useful when testing changes before moving to a production infrastructure. To test the changes, you create separate workspaces for Dev and Production.

A workspace is really a different state file. Each workspace isolates its state from other workspaces. For more information, see [When to use Multiple Workspaces](https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/workspaces.html#when-to-use-multiple-workspaces) from Hashicorp.

Here's an example script where a local value names two workspaces, **default** and **production**, and associates different instance counts with each:


```json
locals {  
  counts = {  
      "default"=1  
      "production"=3  
  }  
}  
  
resource "aws_instance" "my_service" {  
  ami="ami-7b4d7900"  
  instance_type="t2.micro"  
  count="${lookup(local.counts, terraform.workspace, 2)}"  
  tags {  
         Name = "${terraform.workspace}"  
    }  
}
```

In the workspace interpolation sequence, you can see the count is assigned by applying it to the Terraform workspace variable (`terraform.workspace`) and that the tag is applied using the variable also.

Harness will pass the workspace name you provide to the `terraform.workspace` variable, thus determining the count. If you provide the name **production**, the count will be **3**.

In the **Workspace** setting, you can simply select the name of the workspace to use.

You can also use a [stage variable](../../../platform/12_Variables-and-Expressions/harness-variables.md) in **Workspace**.

Later, when the Pipeline is deployed, you specify the value for the stage variable and it is used in **Workspace**.

This allows you to specify a different workspace name each time the Pipeline is run.

You can even set a Harness Trigger where you can set the workspace name used in **Workspace**.
