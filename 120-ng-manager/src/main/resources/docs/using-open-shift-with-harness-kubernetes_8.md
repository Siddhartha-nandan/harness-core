# Notes

* Make sure that you update your version to `apiVersion: apps.openshift.io/v1` and not `apiVersion: v1`.
* The token does not need to have global read permissions. The token can be scoped to the namespace.
* The Kubernetes containers must be OpenShift-compatible containers. If you are already using OpenShift, then this is already configured. But be aware that OpenShift cannot simply deploy any Kubernetes container. You can get OpenShift images from the following public repos: <https://hub.docker.com/u/openshift> and <https://access.redhat.com/containers>.
* Useful articles for setting up a local OpenShift cluster for testing: [How To Setup Local OpenShift Origin (OKD) Cluster on CentOS 7](https://computingforgeeks.com/setup-openshift-origin-local-cluster-on-centos/), [OpenShift Console redirects to 127.0.0.1](https://chrisphillips-cminion.github.io/kubernetes/2019/07/08/OpenShift-Redirect.html).
