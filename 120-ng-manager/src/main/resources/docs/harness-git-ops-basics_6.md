# Service Instance

Service Instances represent the dynamic instantiation of a Service you sync via Harness GitOps.

For example, for a service representing a Docker image, Service Instances are the number of pods running with the Docker image.

A single Service can have multiple Service Instances. For example, one for Dev, one for QA, and one for Prod.
