## Pipelines

A CD Pipeline is a series of Stages where each Stage deploys a Service to an Environment.

A CD Pipeline can perform many additional CD operations, including, but not limited to:

* Propagating Services and their definitions across Stages.
* Approvals using integrations like Jira and ServiceNow.
* Synchronizing stage deployments using barriers.
* Notifications.
* and many other operations.
