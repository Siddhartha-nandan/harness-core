# Permissions

The Harness delegate requires permissions according to the deployment platform and the operations of the Terragrunt and Terraform scripts.

In some cases, access keys, secrets, and SSH keys are needed. You can add these in [Harness secrets management](https://developer.harness.io/docs/first-gen/firstgen-platform/security/secrets-management/secret-management). You can then select them in the Terragrunt Provisioner step.
