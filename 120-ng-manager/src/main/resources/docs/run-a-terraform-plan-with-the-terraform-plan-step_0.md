This topic describes how to run a Terraform script as a Terraform plan using the Harness Terraform Plan step.

You can run the Terraform Plan step to provision any resource, including the target infrastructure for a deployment.

This topic covers using the Terraform Plan step for **non-target** infrastructure.

For steps on using the Terraform Plan to provision the target infrastructure for a deployment, see [Provision Target Deployment Infra Dynamically with Terraform](../../cd-infrastructure/terraform-infra/provision-infra-dynamically-with-terraform.md).
