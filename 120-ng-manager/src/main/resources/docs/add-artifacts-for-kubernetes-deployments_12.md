# Step 2: Create the Harness Service

In **Service**, you can define/select the Service and Service Definition.

Let's take a moment and review Harness Services and Service Definitions (which are explained below). Harness Services represent your microservices/apps logically.  
  
You can add the same Service to as many stages are you need. Service Definitions represent your artifacts, manifests, and variables physically. They are the actual files and variable values.  
  
By separating Services and Service Definitions, you can propagate the same Service across stages and change artifacts, manifests, and variables with each stage.Select or create the Service.

To add your container image, go to **Artifacts** in the Service Definition.
