#### Fail-Fast Thresholds 
You can select the type of events for which you want to set thresholds in CV. Any metric that matches the selected rules will be marked as anomalous and cause the Workflow state to fail.

To set fail-fast thresholds for CV, follow these steps:

1. Go to the **Fail-Fast Thresholds** tab and select the **+ Add Threshold** button.
2. From the **Metric** dropdown, select the desired metric for which you want to set the rule.
3. In the **Action** field, select what the CV should do when applying the rule:
- **Fail Immediately**
- **Fail after multiple occurrences**
- **Fail after consecutive occurrences**
4. In the Count field, set the number of occurrences. This setting is only visible if you have selected **Fail after multiple occurrences** or **Fail after consecutive occurrences** in the **Action** field. The minimum value must be two.
3. In the Criteria field, choose the type of criteria you want to apply for the threshold:
- **Absolute Value**: Select this option and enter the **Greater than** and **Lesser than** values.
- **Percentage Deviation**: Select this option and enter the **Lesser than** value.
