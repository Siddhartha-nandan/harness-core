## Barriers

Barriers synchronize stages/[step groups](../cd-technical-reference/cd-gen-ref-category/step-groups.md) of a Pipeline that are executed in parallel. Barriers ensure that one stage/step group does not proceed until another stage/step group has reached a specific point.

See [Synchronize Parallel Stages and Step Groups using Barriers](synchronize-deployments-using-barriers.md).
