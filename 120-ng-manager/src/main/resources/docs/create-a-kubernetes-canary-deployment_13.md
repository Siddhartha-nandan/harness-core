### Prepare

Here is the log from the Prepare section:

![](./static/create-a-kubernetes-canary-deployment-06.png)

The name of the Deployment workload in the Service Definition **Manifests** file is **my-nginx****.**

As you can see, Harness appends the name with **-canary**, **my-nginx-canary**. This is to identify Canary Deployment step workloads in your cluster.

The next section is **Apply**.
