# Select the Delegate for the stage

You don't have to use the same Delegate for the entire stage. If multiple Delegates are used, Harness will ensure that they can perform the deployment.

For this tutorial, we'll use a single Delegate because we are deploying to its cluster.

1. Click the **Advanced** tab.
2. Click in **Define Delegate Selector** and select the tag of the Delegate you installed earlier.
