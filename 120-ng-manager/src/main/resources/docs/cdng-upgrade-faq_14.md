## Option 1: Harness-assisted upgrade (recommended)

1. You schedule a meeting with the Harness team to help plan for an automated upgrade.
2. Harness reviews the CD FirstGen account and proposes an upgrade plan to you.
3. Harness upgrades the configuration to CD NextGen by using its upgrade APIs. This process will not impact your CD FirstGen setup.
4. You and the Harness team review the upgraded configuration.
5. You build your new CD NextGen pipelines and validate the apps deployed through those pipelines. Harness provides guidance as needed.
6. You and the Harness team work together to ensure a smooth upgrade and meet the agreed upon upgrade timeline.
