# Why make the change?

The v2 experience has more robust service and environment entities. V2 has service variables, independent infrastructure definitions, environment groups, and file and variable overrides. 

With v2, you'll notice a major reduction in the configuration included in pipelines. These changes are also reflected in the Harness APIs.

All new deployment types (ECS, Deployment Template, SSH, WinRM, etc.) are available in v2 only. New innovations such as Enterprise GitOps, multi-services and multi-environments, and environment groups, are in v2 only. 

The new v2 experience has been designed to provided users and organizations with simpler configurations and an improved ability to scale.
