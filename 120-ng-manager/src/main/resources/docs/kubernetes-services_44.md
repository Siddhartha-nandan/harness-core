## Custom artifact source

<details>
<summary>Use artifacts from a custom artifact source</summary>

For enterprises that use a custom repository, Harness provides the Custom Artifact Source.

To use this artifact source, you provide a script to query your artifact server via its API (for example, REST) and then Harness stores the output on the Harness Delegate in the Harness-initialized variableÂ `$HARNESS_ARTIFACT_RESULT_PATH`.

The output must be a JSON array, with a mandatory key for a Build Number/Version. You then map a key from your JSON output to the Build Number/Version variable.

For steps on adding a Custom Artifact source, go to [Add a custom artifact source for CD](../cd-services-general/add-a-custom-artifact-source-for-cd.md).
