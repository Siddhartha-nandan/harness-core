This topic describes how you can use DORA and other advanced metrics for deployments and services in CD Dashboards.

Deployments and Services can be measured within the CD module (**Overview** and **Services** in the **Deployments** module), and using the Harness Platform Dashboards (**Dashboards**). Platform Dashboards also let you create highly advanced custom dashboards.
