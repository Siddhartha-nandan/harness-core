## How can I update the GitOps Agent and related components?

The GitOps Agent comes with an upgrader service that performs upgrades and automatically detects when an upgrade is needed.

If you disable automatic upgrades, we recommend you manually update often since Harness is actively rolling out bug fixes and feature enhancements.

The Argo CD components upgrade must be done manually.
