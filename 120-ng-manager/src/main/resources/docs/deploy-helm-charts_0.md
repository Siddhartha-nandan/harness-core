This topic describes how to deploy Helm charts in standard Helm syntax in YAML from a remote Git repo, HTTP Helm Repository, or cloud storage service (Google Cloud Storage, AWS S3).

This process is also covered in the [Helm Chart deployment tutorial](../../onboard-cd/cd-quickstarts/helm-cd-quickstart.md).
