This topic describes how to view the Deployments (FirstGen) Dashboard and get more information about that data.

:::note

Currently, this feature is behind the Feature Flags `TIME_SCALE_CG_SYNC` and `CUSTOM_DASHBOARD_V2`. Contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io) to enable the feature.

:::

The **FirstGen** custom dashboards in Harness NextGen display information for your Harness FirstGen deployments. See [Harness FirstGen vs Harness NextGen](../../getting-started/harness-first-gen-vs-harness-next-gen.md).

Dashboards help you model and analyze business metrics and operational data. You can use this data to make data-driven business decisions. Using charts, data tables, and filters, Dashboards help you get the most useful deployments data.

Harness provides pre-loaded **By Harness** (pre-defined) and **Custom** (user-defined) Dashboards to visualize deployments data across your Applications, Services, and Environment. Using the **Deployments (FirstGen) Dashboard** you can:

* Discover new analytical insights into your deployment frequency by Application and Pipeline
* Track deployment status across different zones and time range in a logical and structured manner
* View your deployments at a glance, understand the applications with the highest failure rate, analyze deployment status, etc.
