You can create a Jira issue as a step in the execution of a Pipeline using the Create Jira step.

You can add the Create Jira step to a Harness CD stage or an Approval stage.

You can also [update Jira Issues](update-jira-issues-in-cd-stages.md) and [add Jira Approval stages and steps](../../../platform/9_Approvals/adding-jira-approval-stages.md).
