# Option: Notify Slack Channels in User Groups

If you have Harness User Groups that have Slack webhooks set up in their Notification Preferences, you can select those groups and Harness will notify them in addition to the Email, Slack, or PagerDuty settings.

See [Send Notifications Using Slack](../../../platform/5_Notifications/send-notifications-using-slack.md).
