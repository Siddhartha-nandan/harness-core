# Jenkins integration

With the **Jenkins** step, you can execute Jenkins jobs in the stage's shell session.

When executing a job, you can also *dynamically capture* the output from the job, using runtime variables based on the context. You can then use those variables in another step in the same or other stage or pipeline.
