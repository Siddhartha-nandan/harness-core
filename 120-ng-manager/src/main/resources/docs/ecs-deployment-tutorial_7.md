# Add the Harness Service

A Harness Service represents the app you are deploying. It contains any supporting files and the artifact image.

For more information about Services, see [Services and Environments Overview](../cd-concepts/services-and-environments-overview.md).

1. In **Service**, click **New Service**.
2. In **Name**, enter **ECS Tutorial**.

You can see that an ECS Service contains the following:

* Task Definition
* Service Definition
* Scalable Target (Optional)
* Scaling Policy (Optional)
* Artifacts

For this tutorial, we'll set up the Task Definition, Service Definition, and Artifacts.
