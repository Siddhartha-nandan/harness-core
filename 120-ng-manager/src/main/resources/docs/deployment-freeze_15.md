# Freeze all deployments for an account, org, or project

At the top of **Freeze Windows** is the option **Freeze disabled on all deployments for this `[Account/Organization/Project]`**.

This is a global setting in the context of account, org, and project. It enables you to enable and disable all deployments for an account, org, or project for a specific duration.

By default, the setting is disabled, and so all deployments will work except those that are frozen by active freeze windows.

When you enable the setting, you are freezing all deployments. This overrides any active freeze windows.

When you enable this setting you will see **Freeze enabled on all deployments for this `[Account/Organization/Project]` from [duration]**.
