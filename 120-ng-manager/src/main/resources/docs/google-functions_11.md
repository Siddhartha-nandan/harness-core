## Artifacts

In **Artifacts**, you add the location of the function ZIP file in Google Cloud Storage that corresponds to the YAML manifest file you added in **Function Definition**.

You use a Harness GCP connector to connect to your Cloud Storage bucket. The GCP connector credentials should meet the requirements in [Cloud Functions permission requirements](#cloud-functions-permission-requirements).
