### Environment groups

V2 introduces environment groups. You can now aggregate environments and manage them at scale. 

Environment groups are simply a list of environments. You can deploy to a subset of environments within the group or to all of them.

For details on environments groups, go to [Services and environments overview](../cd-concepts/services-and-environments-overview).
