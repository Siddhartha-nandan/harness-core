# To

The email address(es) where you want this Harness pipeline to send an email. 

This setting can use be a comma-separated string of addresses. For example, `john.doe@harness.io, bill.smith@harness.io`.

You can set **To** as a runtime input.
  
You can pass in the email as a Harness expression, such as `<+pipeline.triggeredBy>`.

For more information on runtime inputs and expressions, go to [Fixed Values, Runtime Inputs, and Expressions](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/references/runtime-inputs/).
