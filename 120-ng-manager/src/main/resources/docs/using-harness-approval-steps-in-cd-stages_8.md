# Option: Approver Inputs

In **Inputs to be provided by approver**, you can enter variables and when the approver views the step, they can provide new values for the variables.

If there are multiple approvers, the first approver sees the variables as you entered them in the step. If the first approver enters new values, the next approver sees the values the first approver entered.

A third approver will see all of the variables the first and second approver provided.

The variable values entered by the final approver populate the expressions created from the inputs.

For example, if there were three approvers and you added a Shell Script step that referenced the input variables with an expression, the expression would render the variable values entered by the final, third approver.

You can reference input variables using the `approverInputs` expression:

`<+pipeline.stages.[stage_name].spec.execution.steps.[step_name].output.approverInputs.[variable_name]>`

These variables can serve as inputs to later stages of the same Pipeline, where they support conditional execution or user overrides.Â 

For example, in a subsequent step's **Conditional Execution** settings, you could use an expression that only runs the step if the expression evaluates to 1.

`<+pipeline.stages.Shell_Script.spec.execution.steps.Harness_Approval_Step.output.approverInputs.foo> == 1`
