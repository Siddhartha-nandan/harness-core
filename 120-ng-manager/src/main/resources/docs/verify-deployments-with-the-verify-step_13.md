# Option: Advanced Settings

In Advanced, you can use the following options:

* [Step Skip Condition Settings](../../../platform/8_Pipelines/w_pipeline-steps-reference/step-skip-condition-settings.md)
* [Step Failure Strategy Settings](../../../platform/8_Pipelines/w_pipeline-steps-reference/step-failure-strategy-settings.md)
* [Select Delegates with Selectors](../../../platform/2_Delegates/manage-delegates/select-delegates-with-selectors.md)

By default, Harness adds the following Failure Strategy for **Verification Failures**:

You can change the strategy to perform different actions, but leave the **Verification Failures** type to ensure that the Pipeline rolls back if it fails verification.
