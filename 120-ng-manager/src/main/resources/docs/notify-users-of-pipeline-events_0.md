This topic describes how to notify users of different pipeline events using popular notification methods.

You can send Pipeline event notifications using email and popular communication and incident management platforms.

Event notifications are set up using **Notification Rules** in your Pipeline. You select the types of events to send, and then select how you want to send notifications. When those events occur, Harness sends event information to those channels and recipients.

This topic describes how to set up **Notification Rules** in your Pipeline.

You can set notifications preferences on User Groups also. See [Add and Manage User Groups](../../../platform/4_Role-Based-Access-Control/4-add-user-groups.md).
