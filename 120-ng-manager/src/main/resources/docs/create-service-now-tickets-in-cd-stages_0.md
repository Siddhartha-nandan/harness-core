This topic describes how to create Service Now tickets in CD Stages.

Harness provides the ability to create and manage [ServiceNow change requests](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/rome-it-service-management/page/product/change-management/concept/c_ITILChangeManagement.html), [incident tickets](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/rome-it-service-management/page/product/incident-management/concept/c_IncidentManagement.html), [change tasks](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/rome-it-service-management/page/product/change-management/concept/change-types.html), and [problem type](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/rome-it-service-management/page/product/problem-management/concept/c_ProblemManagement.html) from your Pipeline step using the **ServiceNow Create** step.

You can add the Create ServiceNow step to a Harness CD stage or an Approval stage and do the following:

* Automatically create change requests in ServiceNow to track updates to your build, test, and production environments by adding a **ServiceNow Create** step in your Pipeline.
* Automatically create and assign tickets in ServiceNow to triage and resolve incidents quickly in case of Pipeline failures.
