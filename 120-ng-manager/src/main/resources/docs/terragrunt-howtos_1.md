# Terragrunt provisioning summary

Harness lets you use Terragrunt to provision infrastructure as part of your deployment process. 

Harness can provision any resource that is supported by Terragrunt and the related Terraform provider or plugin.

If you want to use Terraform without Terragrunt, Harness supports that, too. See [Terraform how-tos](../terraform-category/terraform-how-tos.md).
