# What can I do with Harness CD Community Edition?

* Today, Harness CD Community Edition can perform Kubernetes deployments only. This means pulling remote manifests and artifacts and deploying them to a local or remote Kubernetes cluster.
* You can also use Harness CD features such as automated rolling, canary and blue green deployments, automated infrastructure provisioning, integrated approvals and notifications, full YAML-based development, and Harness Git Experience.
* In the near future, AWS (ECS, ASG, CloudFormation, Lambda, etc), Azure (VMSS, WebApps, AKS, ACR, ARM, Blueprint), .NET, Google Cloud Build, VM, Tanzu, Serverless, and traditional (Tomcat, etc) deployments will be supported.  

For the full list of the currently supported integrations, see **Continuous Delivery (CD)** in [Supported Platforms and Technologies](../../../getting-started/supported-platforms-and-technologies.md).
