## Execution Steps

Execution steps perform the CD operations like applying a manifest, asking for approval, rollback, and so on.

Harness automatically adds the steps you need for the deployment strategy you select. You can then add additional steps to perform many other operations.

You can run steps in parallel and apply execution conditions and failure strategies to them individually or as step groups.
