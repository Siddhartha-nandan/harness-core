This topic describes how to add a Harness GitOps Repository containing the declarative description of a desired state.

Harness GitOps Repositories are connections to repos containing the declarative description of a desired state. The declarative description can be in Kubernetes manifests, Helm Chart, Kustomize manifests, etc.

A Harness GitOps Repository is used for Harness GitOps only. For other Harness features like CI, CD Pipelines, etc, use a standard [Git Connector](../../platform/7_Connectors/add-a-git-hub-connector.md).
