## Review: ServiceNow User Roles

You can install the Harness app in your ServiceNow instance from the ServiceNow [store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/application/de154a1e1b75851044cbdb58b04bcb11/1.0.1?referer=%2Fstore%2Fsearch%3Flistingtype%3Dallintegrations%25253Bancillary_app%25253Bcertified_apps%25253Bcontent%25253Bindustry_solution%25253Boem%25253Butility%25253Btemplate%26q%3Dharness&sl=sh). For more information, see [Installation Guide](https://store.servicenow.com/appStoreAttachments.do?sys_id=1fc1632b872f4dd0970e2178cebb35ba).

To configure the Harness app in ServiceNow, you must have the following roles:

* `x_harne_harness_ap.integration_user_role​` : to access supported APIs, view Harness support details and access Templates.
* `itil`​: for end-to-end integration with Harness platform.
