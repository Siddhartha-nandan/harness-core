# Step 2: Set Timeout

Set a default for the step timeout. Leave enough time for the Users in **Approvers** to see and respond to the waiting step.

The default timeout for an Approval step is **1d** (24 hours). 

You can use: 

- `w`  for week
- `d`  for day
- `h`  for hour
- `m`  for minutes
- `s`  for seconds
- `ms` for milliseconds

For example, 1d for one day.

The maximum timeout duration is 24 days.The timeout countdown appears when the step in executed.
