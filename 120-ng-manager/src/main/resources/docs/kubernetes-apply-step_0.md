This topic describes settings for the Kubernetes Apply step.

The Apply step is used to deploy workloads outside of the primary and sidecar workloads of the deployment.

For example, you might want to deploy an additional resource only after Harness has verified the deployment of the main resources in the **Manifests** section.

For the topic on using the step, go to [Deploy Manifests Separately using Apply Step](../../cd-execution/kubernetes-executions/deploy-manifests-using-apply-step.md).
