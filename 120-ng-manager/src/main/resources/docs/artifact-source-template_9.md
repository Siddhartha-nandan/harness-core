# Saving templates to project, org, or account level

If you are creating a template at the Harness project level, in **Save To**, you can select where you want to save the template:

- **Project**: The template is saved to this project. You will see it in the **Templates** list in all of the modules in this project that support templates (Deployments, Builds, Security Tests, etc).
- **Organization**: The template is saved to the org where this project is located. The template will only appear in the **Templates** list at the org level, but the template can be selected in any project in that org.
- **Account**: The template is saved at the account level. The template will only appear in the **Templates** list at the account level, but the template can be selected in any project in the account.

If you create the template at the project level but select **Organization** or **Account** in **Save To**, the template will not appear in the **Templates** list of the project. Navigate to the **Templates** list in the org or account where you saved it to see the template.

This can be a little confusing the first time you create a template because you saved the template in a project but it doesn't appear in that project's **Templates** list. 

You will still be able to select the template in services in this project.
