## Policy as code

Harness NextGen includes Harness Policy as Code, a flexible and customized platform for policy-based control across the software development lifecycle. The feature is based on [Open Policy Agent (OPA)](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/), the open source industry standard. 

Harness Policy as Code does the following for you:

- Provides visibility into regulated applications/environments and exposes which compliance rules were not followed.
- Enforces policies when pipelines are saved or run.
- Finds breaches as early as possible through shift-left governance.
