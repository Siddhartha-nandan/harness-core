## Create the Service

The Harness Service represents what you're deploying. In this case, we're deploying a config.json file.

1. In **Select Service**, click **New Service**.
2. In **Name**, enter **PR Example**.
3. In **Manifests**, click **Add Release Repo Manifest**.
4. In **Release Repo Store**, select **Github**.  

Now we'll add a Github Connector to tell Harness where to pull the config.json from.
