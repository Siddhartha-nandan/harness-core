### Canary

For Canary strategies, Harness calculates phase instances based on the number of hosts and the number of requested instances per phase.

Letâ€™s say you have 10 hosts and you add 2 phases with 50% and 100%. This means Harness deploys on 5 instances in the first phase and on the rest of the instances in the second phase.

Here is an example of the Canary strategy using 2 hosts and 2 phases. The first phase deploys to 50% and the second phase deploys to 100%.

This means, that Harness will roll out to 50% of target hosts first, and then the remaining 50% if the first 50% were successful.

Harness creates 2 phases as step groups.

You can add any Approval steps between the Step Groups. See [Adding ServiceNow Approval Steps and Stages](../../cd-advanced/approvals/using-harness-approval-steps-in-cd-stages.md), [Adding Jira Approval Stages and Steps](../../../platform/9_Approvals/adding-jira-approval-stages.md), and [Adding ServiceNow Approval Steps and Stages](../../../platform/9_Approvals/service-now-approvals.md).

The Looping Strategy for the first Phase selects 50% of the target hosts:

```yaml
repeat:  
  items: <+stage.output.hosts>  
  start: 0  
  end: 50  
  unit: Percentage
```

The Looping Strategy for the second Phase starts at the 50% from the first phase and continues to 100%:

```
repeat:  
  items: <+stage.output.hosts>  
  start: 50  
  end: 100  
  unit: Percentage
```
