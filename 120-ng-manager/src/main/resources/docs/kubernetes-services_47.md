# Pull an image from a private registry

Typically, if the Docker image you are deploying is in a private registry, Harness has access to that registry using the credentials set up in the Harness connector you use with your service **Artifacts**.

If some cases, your Kubernetes cluster might not have the permissions needed to access a private Docker registry. 

For these cases, the values YAML file in Service Definition **Manifests** section must use the `dockercfg` parameter.

If the Docker image is added in the Service Definition **Artifacts** section, then you reference it like this: `dockercfg: <+artifacts.primary.imagePullSecret>`.

This key will import the credentials from the Docker credentials file in the artifact.

Open the values.yaml file you are using for deployment.

Verify that `dockercfg` key exists, and uses the `<+artifacts.primary.imagePullSecret>` expression to obtain the credentials:

```yaml
name: <+stage.variables.name>  
replicas: 2  
  
image: <+artifacts.primary.image>  
dockercfg: <+artifacts.primary.imagePullSecret>  
  
createNamespace: true  
namespace: <+infra.namespace>  
...
```
