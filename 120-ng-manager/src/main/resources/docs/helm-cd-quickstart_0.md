This quickstart shows you how to deploy a publicly available Docker image to your Kubernetes cluster using Helm charts and a Rolling [deployment strategy](../../cd-deployments-category/deployment-concepts.md) in Harness.

All you'll need is a small target cluster to run the Harness Delegate and receive the deployed image.

This quickstart should only take about 15 minutes.
