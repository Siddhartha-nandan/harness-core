The **Verify** step in a CD stage uses Harness Continuous Verification (CV) to verify your deployments.

Harness CV integrates with your APMs and logging tools to:

* Verify that the deployed service is running safely and perform automatic rollbacks.
* Apply machine learning to every deployment to identify and flag anomalies in future deployments.

This topic covers how to add and configure the Verify step.
