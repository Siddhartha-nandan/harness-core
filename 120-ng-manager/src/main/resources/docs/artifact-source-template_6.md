## Repository

1. In the repository setting, select or create the Harness registry connector. For example, if you selected **Docker Registry** in **Artifact Repository Type**, the repository setting is named **Docker Registry Repository**.

For information on registry connectors, go to [Connect to an artifact repo](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/Connectors/connect-to-an-artifact-repo).

You can also select **Runtime input** or **Expression** for this setting.
