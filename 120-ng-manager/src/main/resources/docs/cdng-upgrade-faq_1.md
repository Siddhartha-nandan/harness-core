# What is Harness Continuous Delivery NextGen?

Harness has reimagined Continuous Delivery (CD) and built a new version of its CD product. 

Continuous Delivery is now part of a broader platform known as the Harness Software Delivery Platform. 

We intend for the platform to improve the developer experience. 

Harness NextGen is designed to empower developers to build, deploy, and manage all aspects of their software with ease. 

We took all our research and user feedback from Harness CD FirstGen and redesigned our CD product from the ground up. 

Harness CD NextGen has more deployment integrations, a redesigned UI, an overhauled Git configuration management experience, and a robust self-service experience that empowers dev teams to manage their deployment operations at scale.
