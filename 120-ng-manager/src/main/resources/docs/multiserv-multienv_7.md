# Propagating multiple Services in stages

Service propagation is not supported when using multiple services in a single stage (this is called a multiple service deployment).

When you add subsequent CD stages to a pipeline you cannot propagate the multiple services like you would with one service.

For details on propagating services in stages, go to [Propagate CD services](../cd-services/cd-services-general/propagate-and-override-cd-services.md).
