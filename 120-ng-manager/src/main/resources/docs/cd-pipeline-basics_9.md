## Delegates

The Harness Delegate is a software service you install in your environment that connects to the Harness Manager and performs tasks using your container orchestration platforms, artifact repositories, monitoring systems, etc.

For examples, see:

* [Install a Kubernetes or Docker Delegate](/docs/platform/2_Delegates/install-delegates/overview.md)
