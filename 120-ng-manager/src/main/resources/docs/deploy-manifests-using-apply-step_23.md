# Notes

* The Apply step does not version ConfigMap and Secret objects. ConfigMap and Secret objects are overwritten on each deployment. This is the same as when ConfigMap and Secret objects are marked as unversioned in typical rollouts (`harness.io/skip-versioning: true`). SeeÂ [Kubernetes Releases and Versioning](../../cd-technical-reference/cd-k8s-ref/kubernetes-releases-and-versioning.md).
