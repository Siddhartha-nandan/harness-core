# Job name

Select the Jenkins job (also called a project) to execute. The list is automatically populated using the Jenkins server you set up in the Jenkins connector you selected.

To filter a job, search for its name. If the job is nested, select the top-level folder first, then search for the job name within that path using a secondary field.
