# Create Service

Create a new Service in Harness.

For **Deployment Type**, select **Kubernetes**. Custom Artifact is supported in the Kubernetes deployment type.

You can now see the **Manifests** and **Artifacts** sections.

We'll focus on **Artifacts** to demonstrate Custom Artifact, but you can find information on Manifests in [Kubernetes Services](../k8s-services/kubernetes-services.md).
