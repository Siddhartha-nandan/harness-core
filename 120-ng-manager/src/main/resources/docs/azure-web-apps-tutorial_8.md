## Harness Delegate

As covered in [Harness Platform architecture](../../../getting-started/harness-platform-architecture.md), a Harness Delegate must be installed in your infrastructure for Harness to perform tasks.

You will install a Harness Delegate in your infrastructure as part of adding the Connector for the **App Services Configuration** or **Artifacts**.

There are several types of Delegates you can use for an Azure App Service deployment, such as Kubernetes and Docker Delegates, as listed in the [Delegates](/docs/category/delegates) category.

For Azure Web App deployments, user typically install a Kubernetes Delegate in AKS or a Docker Delegate on a VMSS.
