### What do I need for a CD Pipeline?

1. An artifact to deploy: an artifact is the application or microservice you are deploying. It can be a Docker image, a zip file, etc.
2. A deployment method: this is whatever specification or manifest is needed by the deployment platform you are using, such as a Kubernetes manifest.
3. A place to deploy it: this is your target environment, such as a Kubernetes cluster.

Harness takes care of the rest.
