# Review: Harness Canary Deployments

While you can add multiple steps to a Kubernetes Canary stage, you should simply use the Canary and Primary step groups generated by Harness. Kubernetes deployments have built-in controls for rolling out in a controlled way. The Canary group is a way to test the new build, run your verification, then roll out to the Primary group.A Harness Kubernetes Canary deployment is a little different than a typical Canary deployment.

This is a standard Canary deployment:

Harness does this a little different:

In a typical Canary deployment, all nodes in a single environment are incrementally updated in small phases, with each phase requiring a verification/gate to proceed to the next phase.

This typical method isn't needed for Kubernetes because Kubernetes includes Rolling Update. Rolling Update is a built-in control for rolling out in a controlled way. It incrementally updates pod instances with new ones. New pods are scheduled on nodes with available resources.

A Harness Kubernetes Canary deployment uses two phases, a Canary and a Primary Deployment group:

1. **Group 1:** Harness creates a Canary version of the Kubernetes Deployment object defined in your Service Definition **Manifests** section. Once that Deployment is verified, the Canary Delete step deletes it by default.  
Harness provides a Canary group as a way to test the new build, run your verification, then rollout to the following Primary Deployment group.
2. **Group 2:** run the actual deployment using a Kubernetes Rolling Update with the number of pods you specify in the **Manifests** files (for example, `replicas: 3`).

When you add a Canary Strategy to a stage, Harness automatically generates the steps for Canary and Primary Deployment groups.

If you're new to Kubernetes RollingUpdate deployments, see [Performing a Rolling Update](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/update/update-intro/) from Kubernetes. That guide summaries Rolling Update and provides an interactive online tutorial.Although it isn't covered here, you can also scale your Workloads between the Canary and Rolling steps if you like. You simply add a new Phase and use the Scale step. See [Scale Kubernetes Pods](scale-kubernetes-replicas.md).
