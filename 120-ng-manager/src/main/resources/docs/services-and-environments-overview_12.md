## Service overrides

Service overrides are different from **Environment Configuration** in the following ways:

* Environment **Configuration**: applies to every service that is used with the environment.
* Environment **Service Overrides**: applies to specific services you select. Whenever that service is used with that environment, the **Service Override** is applied.
