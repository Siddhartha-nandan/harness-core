# Using Environment Groups

You can select target Environments and Infrastructures using Environment Groups.

1. In **Environment**, select **Deploy to multiple Environments or Infrastructures**, and then select **Environment Groups**.
2. In **Specify Environment Group**, select one **Environment Group**. You cannot select multiple Environment Groups.
3. In **Specify Environments**, select the Environments you want to use.
4. For each Environment, in **Specify Infrastructures**, select the Infrastructures you want to use.

Here's an example with an Environment Group containing two Environments. One Environment has two Infrastructures and the other has one Infrastructure.
