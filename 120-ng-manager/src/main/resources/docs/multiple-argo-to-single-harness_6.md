# Adding Argo CD entities to Harness automatically

When an Agent contains Argo CD project mappings to a Harness Project, any new entities added to the Argo CD project are added to the mapped Harness Project automatically.

Try adding a new Argo CD repository to the mapped Argo CD project.

Once it's saved in Argo CD, go to Harness and look at the GitOps Repositories in the mapped Harness Project. A new repo is added.
