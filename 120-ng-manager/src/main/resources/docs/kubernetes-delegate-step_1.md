# Canary Delete step vs Kubernetes Delete step

The **Canary Delete** step is only used to delete resources created using the **Canary Deployment**Â step. To delete any Kubernetes resources, use the Kubernetes Delete step. For details, go to [Delete Kubernetes Resources with the Kubernetes Delete Step](../../cd-execution/kubernetes-executions/delete-kubernetes-resources.md).
