## Service Instance

A **Service Instance** is the number of running Service instances at any given moment (pods in case of Kubernetes, hosts in case of SSH-based deployments, etc).

Harness periodically tracks the count of running Service Instances every 10 minutes and stores it in the Harness database.

Harness uses a Service-based license model to charge Harness customers using its Continuous Delivery module.

See [Service-based Licensing and Usage for CD](service-licensing-for-cd.md).
