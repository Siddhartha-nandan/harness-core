Harness NextGen has revamped its AWS ECS support from its [FirstGen implementation](../../../first-gen/continuous-delivery/aws-deployments/ecs-deployment/ecs-deployments-overview.md). This includes how you configure Harness and ECS services and perform rolling, canary, and blue green deployments.

For users coming from Harness FirstGen, this is a significant change and requires time to upgrade previous pipelines.

This topic describes the changes and provides some best practices to help you migrate from FirstGen or create new ECS deployments in Harness.
