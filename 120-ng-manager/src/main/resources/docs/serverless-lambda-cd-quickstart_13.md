## Serverless Deploy Command Options

In **Serverless Deploy Command Options**, you can add any `serverless deploy` command options. See the [Serverless AWS - Deploy](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/cli-reference/deploy) doc for the list of options.

In the deployment logs, you'll see the options added to the serverless deploy command.

For example, if you add `--conceal` in **Serverless Deploy Command Options** you'll see the following:

```
serverless deploy --stage dev --region us-east-1 --conceal
```
