## Name

1. In **Name**, enter a name for the step, for example, **C****reate EC2 Instance**.

Harness will create an [Entity Id](../../../platform/20_References/entity-identifier-reference.md) using the name. The Id is very important. You can use a Harness expression and Id to refer to settings in this step from another step.

See [Built-in and Custom Harness Variables Reference](../../../platform/12_Variables-and-Expressions/harness-variables.md).
