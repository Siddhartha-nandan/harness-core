# Approval step

By default, Harness adds an Approval step between the Terraform Plan and Terraform Apply steps. You can remove this step or follow the steps in [Using Manual Harness Approval Steps in CD Stages](../../cd-advanced/approvals/using-harness-approval-steps-in-cd-stages.md) to configure the step.

You can also use a Jira Approval step. See [Adding Jira Approval Stages and Steps](../../../platform/9_Approvals/adding-jira-approval-stages.md).
