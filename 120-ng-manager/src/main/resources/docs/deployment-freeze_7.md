## Trigger freeze

You can create triggers in Harness to execute a pipeline under multiple conditions, such as a change to a Helm Chart, artifact, etc.

When a freeze is running, triggers will not execute frozen pipelines. The trigger invocations are rejected. 

You can create a freeze window notification to notify users when a trigger invocation was rejected. Notifications are described below.
