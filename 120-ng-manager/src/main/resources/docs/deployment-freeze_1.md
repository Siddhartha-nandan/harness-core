<summary>Deployment freeze summary</summary>

A deployment freeze is a period of time during in which no new changes are made to a system or application. This ensures that a system or application remains stable and free of errors, particularly in the lead-up to a major event or release.

During a deployment freeze, only critical bug fixes and security patches might be deployed, and all other changes are put on hold until the freeze is lifted.

Deployment freezes are commonly used in software development to ensure that a system is not destabilized by the introduction of new code in new application versions.
