# Runtime inputs and expressions in services and environments

If you use runtime inputs in your services and environments, users will need to provide values for these when they run pipeline using these services and environments.

If you use expressions in your services and environments, Harness must be able to resolve these expressions when users run pipeline using these services and environments.

Select **Runtime input** for the service and environment.
