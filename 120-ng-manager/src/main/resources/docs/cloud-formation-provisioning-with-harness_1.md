# CloudFormation Provisioning Options

You can use Harness with CloudFormation in two ways:

* Target Infra Provisioning: provision the target infrastructure for a deployment, and then deploy to that provisioned infrastructure.
* Non-target Provisioning: provision any resources other than the target infrastructure for the deployment.

You can do both in the same stage if you want.
