# Important dates

Please review these important dates before upgrading.

- Service and environment v1 APIs are being deprecated in March 2023.
- On the official EOL date (Jan 31, 2023), v1 services and environments will continue to work as before. After March 2023, pipelines with v1 services and environments might experience issues or even failures because Harness will not update v1 with fixes or enhancements after that date.
- Harness will globally enable service and environments v2 APIs for all customers at the end of January 2023.
- The forced change will reduce the migration effort needed for users.
- Harness has an automated tool to help migrate your services and environments from v1 to v2.

We are happy to assist you in your migration to the new v2 experience. For any questions or comments, please contact `support@harness.io` or your CSM. Together we can work through discovery, migration planning, and assist with the process.
