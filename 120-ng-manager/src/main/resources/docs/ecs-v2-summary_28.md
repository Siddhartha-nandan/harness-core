## Templates and ECS deployments

You can template your pipelines in Harness NextGen.

Harness templates create reusable logic for Harness entities like steps, stages, and pipelines. 

You can link templates in your pipelines or share them with your teams for improved efficiency. 

If you want to use this feature when you create a new entity like a step, click `Start with Template`. For more information, go to [Templates Overview](../../../platform/templates/../13_Templates/template.md).
