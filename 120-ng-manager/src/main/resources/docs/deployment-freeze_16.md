# Deployment freeze best practices

Here are some best practices for implementing a deployment freeze:

- Communicate clearly with all team members about the deployment freeze, including its purpose, duration, and any exceptions that may be made.
- Prioritize critical bug fixes and security updates that must be made during the deployment freeze, and put in place processes for reviewing and approving these changes.
- Ensure that all necessary testing has been completed and that the current state of the system is stable before implementing the deployment freeze.
- Monitor the system closely during the deployment freeze to ensure that it remains stable and that any necessary updates can be made quickly and efficiently.
- After the deployment freeze is lifted, conduct a thorough review of the system to ensure that it is functioning properly and that any changes made during the freeze did not introduce any new issues.
