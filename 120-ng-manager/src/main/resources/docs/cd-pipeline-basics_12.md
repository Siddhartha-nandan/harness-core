## Triggers

You can run your Pipelines manually or use triggers to initiate their execution.

You can trigger a Pipeline based on Git events, manifest changes, schedules, new artifacts, etc.

For examples, see:

* [Trigger Pipelines on a New Artifact](../../../platform/11_Triggers/trigger-on-a-new-artifact.md)
* [Trigger Pipelines on New Helm Chart](../../../platform/11_Triggers/trigger-pipelines-on-new-helm-chart.md)
* [Trigger Pipelines using Git Events](../../../platform/11_Triggers/triggering-pipelines.md)
