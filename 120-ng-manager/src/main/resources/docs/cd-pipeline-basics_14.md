### Inputs and Overlays

Harness Input Sets are collections of runtime inputs for a Pipeline provided before execution.

Overlays are groups of Input Sets. Overlays enable you to provide several Input Sets when executing a Pipeline.

With Input Sets and Overlays, you can make a single Pipeline template that can be used for multiple scenarios. Each scenario can be defined in an Input Set or Overlay and simply selected at runtime.

See [Input Sets and Overlays](../../../platform/8_Pipelines/input-sets.md).
