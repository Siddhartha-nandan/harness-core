This topic describes how to install a Harness GitOps Agent, a worker process that runs in your environment and performs GitOps tasks.

You need to set up an Agent before you can set up a Cluster, Repository, or Application, as the Agent is selected in all three of these.

Typically, you install the Agent in the target cluster, but you can install it any cluster and it can connect to remote clusters using the credentials you provide.
