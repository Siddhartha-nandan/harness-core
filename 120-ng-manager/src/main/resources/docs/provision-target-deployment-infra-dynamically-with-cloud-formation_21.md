# Approval step

By default, Harness adds an Approval step between the Create Stack and Delete Stack steps. You can remove this step or follow the steps in [Using Manual Harness Approval Steps in CD Stages](../../cd-advanced/approvals/using-harness-approval-steps-in-cd-stages.md) to configure the step.

You can also use other Approval step types.
