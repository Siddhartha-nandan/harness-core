# Define the Service

The Harness Service represents your Azure Web App.

You identify the artifact for the app, configuration settings, and any secrets and configuration variables.

1. Click **New Service**.
2. Enter a name for the new Service. The **Azure Web App** deployment type is selected already.

The **Artifact** is required but the rest of the setting are optional, and will depend on your Web App.
