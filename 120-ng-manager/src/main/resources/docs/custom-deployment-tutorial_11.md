Next, we'll add the artifact for deployment to the Harness Service.

You don't always need to add an artifact to the Harness Service. If the script in your deployment step(s) pulls in an artifact, or uses in a hardcoded artifact in a spec or manifest, you can skip adding the artifact to the Harness Service.

1. In **Select Service**, click **Add Service**.
2. Name the new Service **DT Tutorial**.
3. In **Deployment Type**, you can see your template is selected.

Now let's add the Docker image for deployment.
