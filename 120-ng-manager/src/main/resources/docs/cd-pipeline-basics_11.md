## Variables

Pipeline and Stage variables are custom variables you can add and reference in your Pipeline and Stage. They're available across the Pipeline. You can propagate and override their values in later stages.

See [Built-in Harness Variables Reference](../../../platform/12_Variables-and-Expressions/harness-variables.md).
