## Source Module

When you set up the file repo in **Configuration File Repository**, you use a Harness Connector to connect to the repo where the Terraform scripts are located.

Some scripts will reference module sources in other repos and Harness will pull the source code for the desired child module at runtime (during `terraform init`).

In **Source Module**, you can select **Use Connector credentials** to have Harness use the credentials of the Connector to pull the source code for the desired child module(s).

If you do not select **Use Connector credentials**, Terraform will use the credentials that have been set up in the system.

The **Use Connector credentials** setting is limited to Harness Git Connectors using SSH authentication (not HTTPS) and a token.
