This topic describes how to use the Jenkins step in a Harness CD pipeline.

Continuous Integration (CI) can be performed in Harness using the module and [CI Pipelines](../../../continuous-integration/ci-quickstarts/ci-pipeline-basics.md).

If you are using Harness Continuous Delivery (CD) but not Harness Continuous Integration (CI), you can still perform CI using the Jenkins step in your CD stage.

Harness integrates with [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/), enabling you to run Jenkins jobs and dynamically capture inputs and outputs from the jobs.
