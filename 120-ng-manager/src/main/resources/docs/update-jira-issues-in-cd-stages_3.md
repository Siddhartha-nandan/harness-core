# Limitations

* Harness supports only Jira fields of type `Option`, `Array`, `Any`, `Number`, `Date`, and `String`. Harness does not integrate with Jira fields that manage users, issue links, or attachments. This means that Jira fields like Assignee and Sprint are not accessible in Harness' Jira integration.
