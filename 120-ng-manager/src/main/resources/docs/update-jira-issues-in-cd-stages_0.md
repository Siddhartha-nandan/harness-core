This topic describes how to update a Jira issue using the Update Jira step.

You can add the Update Jira step to a Harness CD stage or an Approval stage.

You can also [create Jira Issues](create-jira-issues-in-cd-stages.md) and add [Jira Approval stages and steps](../../../platform/9_Approvals/adding-jira-approval-stages.md).
