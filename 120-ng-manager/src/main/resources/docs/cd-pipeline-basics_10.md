### Credentials and Permissions

The Delegate uses the credentials set up in the Connectors used by the Pipeline to perform deployment tasks.

The Delegate also needs permissions in the target environment to execute deployment tasks. These permissions are granted in the Delegate config file or the environment account you use when installing the Delegate.
