## Environments

The following changes apply to v2 environments:

- Environments are now standalone objects with global environment variables and manifest configurations.
- V2 **Environment Service Overrides** and **Environment Variables** can override service variables when the service is deployed into a given environment. Based on the variable name, Harness can override the service variable with the environment variable value.
- Harness has introduced service-specific environment overrides where users can define specific services and variables they want to override for a given environment.
- For details on environments v2, go to [Services and environments overview](../cd-concepts/services-and-environments-overview).
