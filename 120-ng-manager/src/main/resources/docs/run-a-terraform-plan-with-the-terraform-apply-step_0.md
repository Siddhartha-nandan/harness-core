This topic describes how to apply a Terraform plan or script using the Terraform Apply step.

The Terraform Apply step can apply a Terraform script with or without the Terraform Plan step.

Typically the Terraform Apply step is used with the Terraform Plan step to apply a plan. For steps on using the Terraform Plan step, see [Plan Terraform Provisioning with the Terraform Plan Step](run-a-terraform-plan-with-the-terraform-plan-step.md).

The Terraform Apply step can provision any resource, including the target infrastructure for a CD deployment. For steps on provisioning the target infrastructure for a CD deployment, see [Provision Target Deployment Infra Dynamically with Terraform](../../cd-infrastructure/terraform-infra/provision-infra-dynamically-with-terraform.md).
