# Step 1: Start a Pipeline

This topic assumes you have a Harness Project set up. If not, see [Create Organizations and Projects](../../../platform/organizations-and-projects/create-an-organization.md).

You can create a Pipeline from any module in your Project, or in the **Project Overview**, and then add stages for any module.

Enter a name for the Pipeline and click **Start**. Now you're ready to add a stage.
