# Does upgrading impact Harness CD FirstGen usage?

No. Upgrading to Harness CD NextGen does not impact your existing FirstGen usage. 

Your deployments will continue to run on Harness FirstGen with no impact. 

You can selectively upgrade Harness applications to move over to NextGen and safely test and validate before deprecating usage in FirstGen. 

Your existing FirstGen delegates aren't impacted. They will not receive any Harness CD NextGen tasks for deployment. 

Your FirstGen configuration (applications, services, workflows, pipelines, triggers, etc.) will continue to operate and wonâ€™t be changed when upgrading.
