Harness Continuous Verification (CV) integrates with Elasticsearch to:

* Verify that the deployed service is running safely and performing automatic rollbacks.
* Apply machine learning to every deployment to identify and flag anomalies in future deployments.

This topic describes how to set up an Elasticsearch health source when adding a CV step to your Continuous Deployment (CD).
