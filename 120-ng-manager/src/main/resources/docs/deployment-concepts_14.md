# Which deployment strategy should I use?

It depends entirely on the type of application/service and environment. Most Harness customers are currently using blue/green or canary deployments for mission-critical applications.

In many cases, customers are migrating from blue/green to canary so they can test in production with minimal business impact.

You can also combine many of the above deployment strategies into a single strategy.
