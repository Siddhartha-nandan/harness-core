## Creating services inside a pipeline

To create a service from inside of a pipeline, select the **Services** tab of a new CD stage, then select **New Service**.

Once the service and its service definition are saved, you can select it in any pipeline.

When you select the service in a pipeline, you can select **Edit Service** to edit its **Service Definition**.

When you create the new service you define its **Service Definition**. For example, a Kubernetes **Service Definition** with a Kubernetes manifest and Docker artifact.
