## File path runtime inputs

You can set [Fixed Values, Runtime Inputs, and Expressions](../../../platform/20_References/runtime-inputs.md) for File Path settings.

Here are the options:

* **File Path setting:**
	+ **Fixed Value:** this is the default. Selecting **Fixed Value** means that you will set a static file path or expression in the step.
	+ **Runtime Input:** select this option if you want to enter a value at runtime or using [Input Sets and Overlays](../../../platform/8_Pipelines/input-sets.md).
* **File path field:**
	+ **Fixed Value:** this is the default. Selecting **Fixed Value** means that you will set a static file path in the step.
	+ **Expression:** Selecting **Expression** means that you will use a variable in the step, such as a [stage variable](../../../platform/8_Pipelines/add-a-stage.md).
