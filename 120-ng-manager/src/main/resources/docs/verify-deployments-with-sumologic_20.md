### Define a query

1. In the **Query** field, enter the log query and select **Run Query** to execute it. This displays a sample record in the **Records** field, allowing you to confirm the accuracy of the query you've constructed.
2. In the **Field Mapping** section, select the **Service Instance Identifier** to display the logs, and then select **Get sample log messages**. Sample logs are displayed that help you verify if the query you built is correct.
