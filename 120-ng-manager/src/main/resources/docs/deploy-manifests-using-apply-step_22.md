# Kustomize deployment with the Apply step

You can use the Apply step in your Kustomize deployments.

When you use Kustomize, the **File Path** in the Apply Step should be set according to how you set up the Manifest Details in the Service.

For details, see **Kustomize deployment with the Apply step** in [Use Kustomize for Kubernetes Deployments](../../cd-advanced/kustomize-howtos/use-kustomize-for-kubernetes-deployments.md).
