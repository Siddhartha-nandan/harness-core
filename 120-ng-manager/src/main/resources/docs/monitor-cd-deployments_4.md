# Platform Dashboards

The account-wide Platform Dashboards in Harness contain built-in dashboards that provide advanced details about your deployments and services.

You can also create your own custom dashboards describing dimensions, aggregates, calculations, and data relationships.

The Platform Dashboards use [LookML](https://docs.looker.com/data-modeling/learning-lookml/what-is-lookml), a dependency-tracking tool that provides predefined data types and syntax for data modeling.
