# Create the deploy stage

Pipelines are collections of stages. For this tutorial, we'll create a new pipeline and add a single stage.

1. In your Harness project, select **Pipelines**, select **Deployments**, then select **Create a Pipeline**.

   Your pipeline appears.
2. Enter the name **TAS Quickstart** and click **Start**.

   The new stage settings appear.
