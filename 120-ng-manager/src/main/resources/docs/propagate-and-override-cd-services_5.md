# Multiple service deployment

:::info

A multiple service deployment is when you deploy multiple services in the same stage. Multiple service deployments do not support service propagation.

:::

If you select multiple services in a stage, you cannot propagate them to subsequent stages.

For information on multiple service deployments, go to [Use multiple services and multiple environments in a deployment](../../cd-deployments-category/multiserv-multienv.md).
