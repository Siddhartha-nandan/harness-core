## Role ARN

Enter the AWS Role ARN to use when creating the stack. Use an existing AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) service role that CloudFormation can assume.

This is the same as the role you would use when creating a stack using the AWS console [Permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-console-add-tags.html) setting or CLI.

See [AWS CloudFormation service role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-iam-servicerole.html) from AWS.
