## What Information is Available to Capture?

Any information in the particular shell session of the stage can be set, captured, and exported using one or more Shell Script steps in that stage. In addition, you can set and capture information available using the built-in Harness variables. For more information, see [Built-in Variables List](../../../platform/12_Variables-and-Expressions/harness-variables.md).
