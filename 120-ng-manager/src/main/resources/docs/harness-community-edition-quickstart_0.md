This quickstart shows you how to set up Harness CD Community Edition locally and create a CD Pipeline that deploys a public NGINX image to a local cluster.

Harness CD Community Edition is a lightweight version of Harness that you can download and run on your laptop or any VM with 3GB RAM and 2 CPUs. Harness CD Community Edition is intended to get devs started with Harness quickly without having to sign up for a Harness SaaS account.
