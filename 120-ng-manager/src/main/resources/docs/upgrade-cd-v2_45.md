## Templates

The following changes apply to v2 templates:

- Templates are impacted by the service and environments v2 update.
- Your existing templates in the service and environments v1 experience will run until v1 EOL (see [Important dates](#important-dates)).
- When migrating to v2 service and environments, you must create a new stage template that references the v2 service and environment.
