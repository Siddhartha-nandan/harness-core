# Import set summary

In ServiceNow, an import set is a staging table that contains a temporary copy of data to import into the platform. Import sets can be used to import data from a variety of sources, such as CSV files or JDBC-compliant databases. You can transform that data into a format that can be loaded into ServiceNow tables.

Import Sets are a useful tool for migrating data into ServiceNow, or for regularly importing data from external systems into the platform.
