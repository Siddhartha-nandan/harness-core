# Creating multiple Services and Environments

You can create Services, Environments, and Environment Groups inline when creating your CD stage, or you can create them separately and select them in the stage.

For more information on Services and Environments, go to [Services and Environments Overview](../onboard-cd/cd-concepts/services-and-environments-overview.md).
