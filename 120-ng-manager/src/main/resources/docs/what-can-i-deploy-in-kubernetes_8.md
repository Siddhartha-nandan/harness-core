# Unmanaged Workloads Table

To deploy an object outside of the managed workloads in any strategy, you use the Harness [annotation](kubernetes-annotations-and-labels.md)Â to make it unmanaged: `harness.io/direct-apply: "true"|"false"`. Set to `true` to make a manifest an unmanaged workload.

For example, Harness Canary and Blue/Green steps support a single **Deployment** or **StatefulSet** workload as a managed entity, but you can deploy additional workloads as unmanaged using the `harness.io/direct-apply:true` annotation.



|  | **Apply** | **Rolling** | **Rollback** | **Blue Green** | **Canary** | **Scale** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Any Object** | Yes | Yes | No | Yes:<br/>1 Deployment or StatefulSet mandatory/allowed | Yes:<br/>1 Deployment or StatefulSet mandatory/allowed | No |
