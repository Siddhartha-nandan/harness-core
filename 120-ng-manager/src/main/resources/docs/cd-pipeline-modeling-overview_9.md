## Verification

Harness' Continuous Verification (CV) approach simplifies verification.

Harness CV integrates with your APMs and logging tools to:

* Verify that the deployed service is running safely and perform automatic rollbacks.
* Apply machine learning to every deployment to identify and flag anomalies in future deployments.
