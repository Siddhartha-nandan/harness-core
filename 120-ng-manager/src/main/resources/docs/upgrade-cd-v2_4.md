# API changes

Harness has introduced the following new APIs to support the v2 experience:

- [Environments](https://apidocs.harness.io/tag/Environments#operation/createEnvironmentV2)
- [Services](https://apidocs.harness.io/tag/Services#operation/createServiceV2)

For steps on using these APIs, go to [Migrating from v1 services and environments to v2](#migrating-from-v1-services-and-environments-to-v2).
