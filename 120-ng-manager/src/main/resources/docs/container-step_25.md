## Image

1. Enter the image and tag to use for this container, for example: `maven:3.6.3-jdk-8` or `curlimages/curl:7.73.0`.

If you are fetching the image from a provider that requires the Docker image's FQN (fully-qualified name), such as GCR or ECR, use the FQN here. 

Here are some examples:

- Docker Hub: `maven:3.6.3-jdk-8`
- GCR: `us.gcr.io/playground-123/my-image`
- ECR: `40000005317.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/todolist:0.2`
