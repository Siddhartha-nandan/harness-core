## Option: Tags

Tags are arbitrary key-value pairs that can be used to identify your stack for purposes such as cost allocation.

A **Key** consists of any alphanumeric characters or spaces. Tag keys can be up to 127 characters long.

A **Value** consists of any alphanumeric characters or spaces. Tag values can be up to 255 characters long.

Enter the tags in JSON or YAML (lowercase is required):


```json
[{  
    "key": "string",  
    "value": "string"  
},{  
    "key": "string",  
    "value": "string"  
}]
```
