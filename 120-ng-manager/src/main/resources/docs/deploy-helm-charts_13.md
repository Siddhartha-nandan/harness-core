# Step 2: Define the infrastructure and execution

There is nothing unique about defining the target cluster infrastructure definition for a Helm chart deployment. It is the same process as a typical Harness Kubernetes deployment.

For more information, go to [Define Your Kubernetes Target Infrastructure](../../cd-infrastructure/kubernetes-infra/define-your-kubernetes-target-infrastructure.md).

Helm charts can be deployed using any of the execution steps and deployment strategies used in other Kubernetes deployments. For more information, go to [Kubernetes How-tos](/docs/category/kubernetes).
