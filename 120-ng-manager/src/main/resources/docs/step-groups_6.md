# Option: Conditional Execution

A step group can have its own Conditional Execution settings separate from the Conditional Execution settings for the Stage. The Conditional Execution settings of the step group apply to all of its steps.

See [Step Skip Condition Settings](../../../platform/8_Pipelines/w_pipeline-steps-reference/step-skip-condition-settings.md).

The Conditional Execution settings of any step in a step group overrides the Conditional Execution settings of the step group.

If you do not use step group Conditional Execution settings, then the Stage's Conditional Execution settings are used.
