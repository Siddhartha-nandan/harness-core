# Are all features from FirstGen available in NextGen?

Yes. NextGen has feature parity. 

Some deployment capabilities have been overhauled:
- AWS ECS deployments have a significantly different experience from FirstGen.
- Deployment templates have been extended. 
- Traditional (SSH and WinRM) deployments have a new configuration experience.
- Infrastructure provisioners in FirstGen are now provisioning steps in NextGen. You can manage the entire infrastructure provisioning configuration in each step.
