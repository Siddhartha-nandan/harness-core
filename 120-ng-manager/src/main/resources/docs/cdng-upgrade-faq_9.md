## Delegate

Harness NextGen supports an improved delegate. It uses a new type of [image](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/Delegates/delegate-concepts/delegate-image-types) and supports the following features:

- Deploy delegate images with or without third-party client tools. We recommend you use the delegate minimal image for added security.
- By default,  the delegate is automatically updated. There is an option to disable automatic updates.
