# Option: Skip Rendering of Manifest Files

In some cases, you might not want to use Go templating because your manifests use some other formatting.

Use the **Skip Rendering K8s manifest files** option in the [Kubernetes Apply](../../../first-gen/continuous-delivery/kubernetes-deployments/deploy-manifests-separately-using-apply-step.md) step if you want Harness to skip rendering your manifest files using Go templating.
