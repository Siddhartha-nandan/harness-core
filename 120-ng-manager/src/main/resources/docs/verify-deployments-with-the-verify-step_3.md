# Review: What is Harness Continuous Verification (CV)?

The more often you deploy software, the more you need to validate the health of newly deployed service instances. You need the ability to rapidly detect regressions or anomalies, and to rapidly roll back failed deployments.

You have your choice of state-of-the-art APM (application performance monitoring) and logging software to continually measure your deployment data. But before Harness, you needed to connect your data to these multiple systems, and manually monitor each provider for unusual, post-deployment activity.

Harness' Continuous Verification (CV) approach simplifies verification. Harness uses machine learning to identify normal behavior for your applications. This allows Harness to identify and flag anomalies in future deployments, and to perform automatic rollbacks.
