# Harness Platform Integration

Harness GitOps takes advantage of all the Harness platform features, such as Access Control, REST APIs, monitoring, auditing, etc.

The Harness GitOps Agent runs in your environment, but the remaining GitOps features are run in Harness SaaS. You do not need to devote resources to running a frontend for administration or dashboards and Harness manages backend resources other than the Agent.
