# Multiple Managed Workloads

With the Rolling Deployment step, you can deploy multiple managed workloads.

For Canary and Blue/Green steps, only one managed object may be deployed per step by default.

You can deploy additional objects using the [Apply Step](deploy-manifests-using-apply-step.md), but it's typically used for deploying Jobs controllers.
