## Queue Steps

Queue Steps synchronize Pipeline executions, queuing Pipelines using a custom key.

Multiple deployments are queued so that one deployment completes before other deployments with the same key can proceed.

See [Control Resource Usage with Queue Steps](control-resource-usage-with-queue-steps.md).
