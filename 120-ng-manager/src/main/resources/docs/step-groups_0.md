Steps can be added to Pipelines individually or as a step group.

Individual steps and steps in step groups can be run serially or in parallel.

Unlike individual steps, a step group can apply Conditional Execution (skip conditions), Failure Strategy, and Rollback steps to all steps in the group.

You can also run Pipeline **stages** in parallel. Deploy multiple services simultaneously and perform flow control using Barriers. See [Synchronize Deployments using Barriers](../../cd-deployments-category/synchronize-deployments-using-barriers.md).This topic describes how to add a Step Group in a stage.
