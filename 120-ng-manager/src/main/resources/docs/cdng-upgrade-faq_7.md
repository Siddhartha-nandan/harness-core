## Continuous Verification (CV) NextGen

Harness CV integrates with your APMs and logging tools to:

- Verify that the deployed service is running safely and perform automatic rollbacks.
- Apply machine learning to every deployment to identify and flag anomalies in future deployments.

Following are some CV features:

- Harness includes a **Verify** step that queries logging and metrics providers from multiple sources at once.
- Next, Harness uses its AI/ML-driven verification capability to automatically validate deployment quality. This capability reduces risk and provides a safety net when code is deployed to production.
- Integrations include Prometheus, Splunk, Google Cloud Operations, Datadog, and other leading logging and metrics providers.
