## Propagation and input sets

If you propagate a service from one stage to another, the stages must use the same input set.

For example, if you have Stage 1 using Input Set A, and you propagate its service to Stage 2, Stage 2 must use Input Set A.

If Stage 2 uses a different input set, the service cannot propagate from Stage 1 to Stage 2.
