## Environments and Infrastructure

Environments represent your deployment targets logically (QA, Prod, etc). You can add the same Environment to as many Stages as you need.

Infrastructure Definitions represent an Environment's infrastructure physically. They are the actual target clusters, hosts, etc.

For an example, see [Kubernetes Infrastructure](../../cd-infrastructure/kubernetes-infra/define-your-kubernetes-target-infrastructure.md).
