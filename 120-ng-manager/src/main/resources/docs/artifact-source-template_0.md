Currently, artifact source templates are behind the feature flag `ARTIFACT_SOURCE_TEMPLATE`. Contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io) to enable the feature.

Harness templates help you standardize your pipelines for your DevOps teams. Team members can select stage, step, and other templates instead of having to create them.

An artifact source template helps you define the repositories, paths, and tags for an artifact that your team can use in Harness CD services. You can define the artifact source template and your team members can select them when they use services in their pipelines.

This topic describes how to create an artifact source template and use it in a stage template and a Harness service.
