The Command step can be used in SSH and WinRM deployments to run commands on all target hosts.

You can run a script on all hosts, download the deployment artifact, or copy the artifact or config.

You can also use the Command step on Deployment Template deployments. Since a Deployment Template can be used on any host type, the Command step can only be run on the Delegate.
