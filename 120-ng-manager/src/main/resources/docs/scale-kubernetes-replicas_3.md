# Step 2: Pick Count or Percentage

The **K8s Scale** step updates the number of instances running, either by count or percentage.

In **Instances**, select **Instance Count** or **% Percentage**.

* **Instance Count**: The number is simply the number of pods.
* **Percentage**: A percentage of the pods defined in your Harness Service **Manifests** files.
