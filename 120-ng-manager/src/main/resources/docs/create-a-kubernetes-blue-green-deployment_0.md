This topic will walk you through creating a Blue Green deployment in Harness for a Kubernetes Deployment workload.

For information on Blue/Green deployments, see [Deployment Concepts and Strategies](../../cd-deployments-category/deployment-concepts.md).

Harness Canary and Blue/Green strategies only support Kubernetes Deployment workloads. The Rolling strategy supports all other workloads, except Jobs. The [Apply Step](deploy-manifests-using-apply-step.md) can deploy any workloads or objects.
