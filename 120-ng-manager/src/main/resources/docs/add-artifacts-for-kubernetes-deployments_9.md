# Review: Container Registry Support

Harness supports all of the popular container registries. You can add your container registry account as a Harness Connector.

The Connector can be added in line when you select your artifacts or separately in **Project Setup** (for Projects) or **Account Resources** (for accounts).

For steps on setting up each artifact server as a Connector, see the following [Connect to an Artifact Repo](../../../platform/7_Connectors/connect-to-an-artifact-repo.md).

If you are using Google Container Registry (GCR) or Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR), see [Cloud Platform Connectors](/docs/category/cloud-platform-connectors).
