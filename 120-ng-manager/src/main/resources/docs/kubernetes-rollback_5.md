# Rolling Rollback Step

You can add a **Rolling Rollback** step to roll back the workloads deployed by the [Rolling Deployment](../../cd-execution/kubernetes-executions/create-a-kubernetes-rolling-deployment.md) step.

Simply add this step where you want to initiate a rollback. Note that this step applies to the deployments of the Rolling Deployment command, and not the [Apply Step](../../cd-execution/kubernetes-executions/deploy-manifests-using-apply-step.md).
