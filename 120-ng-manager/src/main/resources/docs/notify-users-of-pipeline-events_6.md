# Option: Email Notifications

For email notifications, simply type in the email addresses that you want to notify.

Enter multiple addresses as a comma-separated list. For example, `john.doe@example.io,qateam@example.io`.

Here's an example of an email notification for the Pipeline Start event:

Along with the start date and who triggered the Pipeline, the email includes a link to the Pipeline execution in Harness.
