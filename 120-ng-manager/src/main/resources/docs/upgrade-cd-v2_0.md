This is an End of Life (EOL) notice for the CD NextGen service and environment v1 experience.

:::

To provide the best software delivery experience for our customers, Harness has introduced an enhanced experience for service and environment entities in the CD NextGen platform. We have named this enhanced experience **service and environment v2**.

**The v2 experience goes into effect as the default experience on Jan 31, 2023.**

Except for specific Harness accounts, the current v1 experience will be removed from all accounts on that date.
