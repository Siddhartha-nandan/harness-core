## Restrict access to specific services or environments for a user or user group

You can restrict a user or user group to using specific services and environments only. The process is the same for services and environments.Â 

Let's look at an example using environments.

If you want to restrict a user or user group to deploy to a specific environment only, do the following:

1. create a resource group and select the environment.
2. Create a Role and give the user or user group permissions. The **Access** permission is needed for deployments.
3. Assign the role and resource group to the user or user group.
