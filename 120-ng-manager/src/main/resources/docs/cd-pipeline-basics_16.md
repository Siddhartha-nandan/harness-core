### Failure Strategies

A failure strategy defines how your Stages and steps handle different failure conditions.

The failure strategy contains error conditions that must occur for the strategy to apply, and actions to take when the conditions occur.

Failure strategies are a critical pipeline design component that determine what fails a step or stage and what to do when the failure occurs.

See [Step and Stage Failure Strategy References](../../../platform/8_Pipelines/define-a-failure-strategy-on-stages-and-steps.md).
