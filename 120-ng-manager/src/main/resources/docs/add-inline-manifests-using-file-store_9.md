# Example Manifests

Manifests can use hardcoded values or a Value YAML file and templating. Harness supports Go templating. See [Example Kubernetes Manifests using Go Templating](../../cd-technical-reference/cd-k8s-ref/example-kubernetes-manifests-using-go-templating.md).

Use the following manifests to copy into your blank manifest files in File Store and save them. Then, customize them for your environment, and apply them to your Pipelines.
