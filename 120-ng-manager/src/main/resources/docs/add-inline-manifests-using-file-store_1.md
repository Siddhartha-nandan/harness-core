# Review: File Store

File Store is a hierarchical file manager in Harness for managing configuration files used in Pipelines.

With File Store, you can perform all of the standard file manager tasks:

* Create and edit folders and files at the Account, Organization, or Project level.
* Upload existing configuration files from your machine to a folder in File Store.
* Select configuration files or folders for deployments.

You can use a combination of File Store and remote repos for your configuration files. You aren't limited to one method.Â
