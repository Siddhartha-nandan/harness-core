This topic will walk you through creating a Canary deployment in Harness for a Deployment workload.

Harness Canary and [Blue/Green](create-a-kubernetes-blue-green-deployment.md) stage steps only support Kubernetes Deployment workloads. The [Rolling Deployment](create-a-kubernetes-rolling-deployment.md) step supports all other workloads except Jobs. The [Apply step](deploy-manifests-using-apply-step.md) can deploy any workloads or objects.
